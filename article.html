          <p class='main-p'>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist
            named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford,
            stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond
            the world of known physics.</p>
          <p class="main-p">He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that
            should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made
            the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic
            evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive
            force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously
            violent instant.</p>
          <p class="main-p">If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from
            pole
            to pole and not like
            a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those
            particles
            were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.</p>
          <p class="main-p">“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box
            around it.</p>
          <p class="main-p">On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the
            beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.</p>

          <p class="main-p">Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes
            at
            the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
            Astrophysics
            detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a universe
            being
            wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old.
            They
            are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr.
            Guth
            was correct.</p>
          <p class="main-p">Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth,
            wondered whether it could ever be proved.</p>
          <p class="main-p">If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the
            recent
            discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of
            time and space and energy to science and speculation.</p>
          <p class="main-p">Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years
            in
            space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose
            extent,
            architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of
            other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.</p>

          <h3 class='section-heading'>'As Big as It Gets'</h3>

          <p class="main-p">In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies
            forever
            beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s
            ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory
            of
            general relativity, should ruffle space-time.</p>
          <p class="main-p">Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of
            the
            team, said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”</p>
          <p class="main-p">He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded
            in
            gravitational waves.”</p>
          <p class="main-p">The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation
            that
            permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the
            surface
            of the sun.</p>
          <p class="main-p">Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background
            Imaging
            of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for
            Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.</p>

          <p class="main-p">Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.</p>
          <p class="main-p">Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such a
            definite
            confirmation in his lifetime.</p>
          <p class="main-p">“With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”</p>
          <p class="main-p">The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and
            analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select
            few,
            meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son,
            Larry,
            who was sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.</p>
          <p class="main-p">“It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr.
            Kovac,
            who chose his words as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.</p>
          <p class="main-p">Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant
            of
            inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when
            Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, knocked on his door with a bottle of

          <p class="main-p">Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.</p>
          <p class="main-p">“And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did
            not
            think that we ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde
            wrote
            in an email.</p>
          <p class="main-p">Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still
            hyperventilating.
            “Having news like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.</p>
          <p class="main-p">By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and
            news
            spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.</p>
          <p class="main-p">Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this stays true,
            it
            will go down as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.”</p>
          <p class="main-p">John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing
            project called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are
            beautiful
            and very convincing,” he said.</p>
          <p class="main-p">Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that posits the clash
            of
            a
            pair of universes as the cause of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model,
            but
            he
            expressed reservations about inflation.</p>
          <p class="main-p">Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation,
            noting
            that the new results exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the
            European Space Agency’s Planck satellite and other assumptions about the universe.</p>
          <p class="main-p">“So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said.</p>
          <p class="main-p">Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its own
            findings
            this year. At least a dozen other teams are trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and
            space.

          <h3 class='section-heading'>Spirals in the Sky</h3>

          <p class="main-p">Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves,
            which
            were discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel
            Prize.</p>
          <p class="main-p">Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four
            leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole,
            where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University
            of
            Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.</p>
          <p class="main-p">“The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,” Dr. Kovac
            said.
            He has been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.</p>

          <p class="main-p">In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was polarized,
            meaning the light waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.</p>
          <p class="main-p">This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from
            inflation.
            Such waves, squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the
            direction of polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the polarization in the
            sky
            should have little arrows going in spirals.</p>
          <p class="main-p">Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the
            temperature
            of the microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.</p>
          <p class="main-p">“We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.</p>
          <p class="main-p">The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year burning up time
            on
            a
            Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had things right and worrying that competitors might beat them to
            the
            breakthrough.</p>

          <h3 class='section-heading'>A Special Time</h3>

          <p class="main-p">The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr. Guth, staying up
            late
            in his Palo Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the universe.
          </p>
          <p class="main-p">Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity, electromagnetism, and
            strong and weak nuclear forces. But they have long suspected that those are simply different manifestations
            of
            a
            single unified force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest moments.</p>
          <p class="main-p">As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, like some old
            folk mythology of gods or brothers falling out with each other. The laws of physics evolved, with one force
            after another splitting away.</p>
          <p class="main-p">That was where Dr. Guth came in.</p>
          <p class="main-p">Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature falls below 32
            degrees, until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.</p>
          <p class="main-p">Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too long. In that
            case,
            space itself would become imbued with a mysterious latent energy.</p>
          <p class="main-p">Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of antigravity,
            and
            the universe would blow itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive force, the more space
            was
            created, the harder it pushed apart.</p>
          <p class="main-p">What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion
            trillionfold
            —
            from a submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic
            eye-blink.
          </p>
          <p class="main-p">Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary particles and radiation.
            All
            of normal cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky and stars
            billions of light-years across. “It’s often said that there is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth
            likes
            to
            say, “but the universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”</p>
          <p class="main-p">Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. Guth’s original
            vision suggest that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a
            comfortable
            homey expansion, the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles endlessly, a
            concept known as the multiverse.</p>
          <p class="main-p">So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking about
            going
            any deeper into the past.</p>
          <p class="main-p">We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because inflation
            erases everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept away,
            forever out of our view.</p>
          <p class="main-p">“If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who
            was
            not part of the team, “you wind up at inflation.”</p>
